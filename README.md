# Impact-of-Displaying-Calorie-Information-on-Menus

*Background/Introduction*
Obesity and overconsumption of high-calorie foods are prevalent issues in the United States. To address these concerns, policies and mandates have been implemented to require food manufacturers and retailers to label calorie information on their products, allowing consumers to make informed choices regarding their calorie intake. Additionally, in 2018 the FDA required food establishments with 20 or more locations to display Calorie information on their menus. Calorie information on restaurant menus is also becoming more widespread, even mandatory for all establishments in certain states, to help inform consumers and ultimately reduce the consumption of calorie-excessive foods. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the presence of calorie information on a restaurant’s menu affects consumer food choices.

*Research Question*
Does displaying calorie information on a restaurant’s menu affect consumer food choices?

*Hypothesis*
We hypothesize that including calorie information on restaurant menus will lead consumers to choose lower-calorie food options.

*Treatment & Experimental Design*
This study employed a within-subjects experimental design to investigate the impact of calorie menu labeling on food choices at a restaurant. The participants in this study ranged in age from 18 to 73 and were recruited from the local community. A diverse group of participants was recruited in terms of gender and occupation, with a total of 110 participants recruited for this study.

The survey began by collecting basic information from each participant, including age, gender, dietary preferences or restrictions, health conditions that affected food choices, and how often they ate out per week. Participants were then presented with a restaurant menu and asked to select the food items they would like to order. After making their initial selections, a second menu was shown that displayed the calorie count for each food item. Participants were asked to make their food choices again and explain whether or not they changed their selection after seeing the calorie information.

To assess the impact of calorie labeling, participants’ food choices before and after the treat- ment were compared. Additional information was gathered to gauge participants’ attitudes towards calorie information, like whether they typically considered it when making food choices, whether they were currently on a diet, and their estimated daily calorie intake and activity levels.

The data collected from this study was organized into a table with columns for experiment subjects, including their age, gender, as well as the number of participants in total. The table also included columns for participants’ food choices before and after the treatment, as well as their attitudes towards calorie information. By using a within-subjects design, individual differences in food preferences were controlled for, providing a more accurate assessment of the impact of calorie labeling on food choices.


*Target Outcome*
We measured the calorie count of the items chosen before and after presenting the treatment menu. The control menu was shown first without calorie information, and the treatment menu was shown after with calorie information. We used a paired T-test to measure the average treatment effect (ATE) and conditional average treatment effect (CATE) based on gender, health conscientiousness, and physical activity levels. We also used regression analysis to validate our results and provide further insights.
